# Store-Management-System
Backend for an online store management system.

The system consists of two parts: one for user authentication and authorization, and one for store management. The system supports three types of users: customers, owners, and couriers. Customers can search for products, place orders, and confirm deliveries. Owners can add products and view sales statistics. Couriers can pick up and deliver orders.

The system is implemented using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Docker, Spark, and Ethereum (Solidity, web3.py). The system uses Spark to calculate the sales statistics for the owners over multiple nodes and Ethereum to handle the payment transactions for the orders.
